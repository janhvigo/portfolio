  <h1>Publishing Research: <em>Generational Dynamics in the Marketing Funnel</em></h1>
  <p>
    In August 2023, I had the opportunity to publish a co-authored research paper titled 
    <em>‚ÄúGenerational Dynamics in the Marketing Funnel‚Äù</em> in the 
    <strong>International Journal of Novel Research and Development (IJNRD)</strong> 
  </p>
  <p>
    This research explored how different generations interact with the different stages 
    of a modern marketing funnel: Awareness, Consideration, Conversion, and Loyalty. Our goal was to identify 
    generational patterns that could help marketers tailor their strategies more effectively. One of the key findings 
    was that <strong>loyalty tends to increase with age</strong>, while younger generations display greater variability 
    in the awareness and consideration stages.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project involved survey-based data collection, statistical correlation analysis, and interpretation of 
    consumer behavior through a generational lens. It was a hands-on experience in applying marketing theory, 
    data analysis, and academic writing in a structured and publishable format.
  </p>
  <p>
    The paper was accepted by IJNRD and published in <strong>Volume 8, Issue 8 (August 2023)</strong>. 
    This experience not only strengthened my research and writing skills but also gave me a clearer understanding 
    of how theory translates into practical business insights.
