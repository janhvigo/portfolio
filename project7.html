  <h1>Airbnb Market Analyser ‚Äì Using Data to Guide Smarter Pricing Decisions</h1>
  
  <p>
    In this project, I developed a data-driven market analysis tool that allows Airbnb hosts in Berlin to understand the local market, identify high-performing areas, and set competitive prices for their listings. The project combines SQL for data querying and Streamlit for interactive dashboards, creating a user-friendly platform for real-time exploration of market trends.
  </p>

  <h2>Key SQL Analyses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Revenue by Neighbourhood:</strong> Summed <code>price √ó number_of_reviews</code> to estimate which areas bring in the most income for hosts.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheapest Listings with Good Reviews:</strong> Identified budget-friendly listings with strong review counts to highlight competitive value options.</li>
    <li><strong>Price Distribution by Room Type:</strong> Calculated min, average, and max prices for each room category to benchmark pricing strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Most Reviewed Listings:</strong> Ranked properties by total review count to highlight market leaders.</li>
    <li><strong>Cumulative Reviews Over Time:</strong> Used SQL window functions to show month-by-month growth in reviews for each listing.</li>
    <li><strong>Listing Value Categories:</strong> Applied a CASE statement to classify properties into ‚ÄúTop Budget Pick,‚Äù ‚ÄúBest Mid-Range,‚Äù or ‚ÄúNiche/Premium.‚Äù</li>
    <li><strong>Neighbourhood Review Trends for 2025:</strong> Filtered and grouped reviews by year to identify the most in-demand areas for the current year.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>SQL & Streamlit Roles</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of the SQL component in this project was to extract, clean, and analyse Airbnb Berlin dataset insights that directly support host decision-making. Hence, SQL was mainly used to identify top-revenue neighbourhoods, competitive pricing ranges, review patterns, and market trends. These foundations ensure that every insight is grounded in actual market performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Streamlit dashboard then transformed these SQL insights into an interactive, user-friendly application where hosts can filter results, visualise trends, and explore neighbourhood-specific opportunities in real time. By combining SQL‚Äôs analytical power with Streamlit‚Äôs accessibility, the project delivers both depth of analysis and ease of use, making it a practical tool for Airbnb hosts to set competitive prices, choose profitable locations, and monitor their listing‚Äôs market position. The tool becomes an easy-to-use guide for hosts to price their properties based on quantitative market research insights, rather than ‚Äòinstinctive‚Äô pricing.
